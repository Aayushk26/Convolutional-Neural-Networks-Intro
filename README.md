# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-Intro
A basic CNN architecture.
- This is a simple cat/dog classifier. 
- The model was trained on 8000 images of cats and dogs.
- Final accuracy achieved was about 90 %
- Accuracy of 99% was achieved without using augmentation, this is a case of overfitting.
- The 89 % accuracy is achieved by setting the epochs> 25
